**Key Considerations:**

* **NO BUFFER:** This schedule hits the end date precisely. Any delay on any step will push Omicron past the end of the year. Strongly recommend adding buffer time or reducing scope per version.
* **Scope Management:** Essential to keep features tightly defined for each release.
* **Testing:** Time for thorough testing and bug fixing is *not* explicitly broken out and needs to be included *within* the weeks allocated for each version.
* **Projects (Lambda/Mu/Nu):** This block still requires significant, focused effort.
* **Paid Plan (Omicron):** 3 weeks is very fast for integrating billing, testing security, and implementing feature gating.

Use this specific schedule as a very optimistic planning tool, but be ready to adapt as you progress.
